# Planner Application
A calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day.

## Description
This webpage contains a planner application. The aim was to create a planner application which stores user input to loca storage and informs the user of the current time based on a colour scheme with grey meaning the time has passed, red being the current time and green being the time left for the day. Throughout this project, I have developed an understanding of local storage and how dayjs can be used. I also developed my knowledge and understanidng of how to use bootstrap to format a web application. 

## Installation

To work on this code copy this SSH key: git@github.com:chelsea32568/planner-app.git and paste into your desired folder using Git Bash. Then use git pull to pull the file into your local repository. Make necessary changes and then add changes into the git repository by using git add -A, git commit -m "", git push.

## Usage

After opening the HTML file the Planner Application appears.

![Image colour indicating the time. Grey shows time has passed, red shows the present time and green shows the future time.](./assets/img/timeColour.JPG)

The colours indicate the time for the user

!['Wake Up' message saved to local storage on the application'](./assets/img/localStore.JPG)

Users can log information and press save to save the text to local storage. This is then retreived even if the application is closed and reopened. 

![The top of the planner application showing the current date and day](./assets/img/now.JPG)

The top of the planner application is updated with the current day and date using day js.
